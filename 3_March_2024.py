Task:- 
Two friends like to pool their money and go to the ice cream parlor. They always choose two distinct flavors and they spend all of their money.

Given a list of prices for the flavors of ice cream, select the two that will cost all of the money they have.

Example: 
m = 6, cost = [1, 3, 4, 5, 6]
The two flavors that cost  and  meet the criteria. Using 1-based indexing, they are at indices 1 and 4.

Function Description:
Complete the icecreamParlor function in the editor below.
icecreamParlor has the following parameter(s):
 int m: the amount of money they have to spend
 int cost[n]: the cost of each flavor of ice cream

Returns:
int[2]: the indices of the prices of the two flavors they buy, sorted ascending
'''

'''
Input Format:- 
The first line contains an integer, t, the number of trips to the ice cream parlor. The next t sets of lines each describe a visit.
Each trip is described as follows:
 1. The integer m, the amount of money they have pooled.
 2. The integer n, the number of flavors offered at the time.
 3. n space-separated integers denoting the cost of each flavor: cost[cost[1], cost[2],...,cost[n]].
Note: The index within the cost array represents the flavor of the ice cream purchased.
'''

'''
Constraints:- 
 1 ≤ t ≤ 50 
 2 ≤ m ≤ 10^4 
 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4 
 1 ≤ cost[i] ≤ 10^4, ∀ i ∈ [1, n]
 There will always be a unique solution.

Explanation:-
Sunny and Johnny make the following two trips to the parlor:
 1. The first time, they pool together m = 4 dollars. Of the five flavors available that day, flavors 1 and 4 have a total cost of 1 + 3 = 4.
The second time, they pool together m = 4 dollars. Of the four flavors available that day, flavors 1 and 2 have a total cost of 2 + 2 = 4.
