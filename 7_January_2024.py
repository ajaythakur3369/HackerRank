'''
Task:- 
Given an array, A, of N integers, print A's elements in reverse order as a single line of space-separated numbers.
'''

'''
Example:- 
A = [1, 2, 3, 4]

Print 4 3 2 1. Each integer is separated by one space.
'''

'''
Input Format:- 
The first line contains an integer, N (the size of our array).
The second line contains N space-separated integers that describe array A's elements.
'''

'''
Constraints:- 
 1 ≤ N ≤ 1000
 1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 10000, where A[i] is the ith integer in the array.
'''

'''
Output Format:- 
Print the elements of array A in reverse order as a single line of space-separated numbers.
