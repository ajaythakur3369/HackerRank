Task:- 
Given an array of n distinct integers, transform the array into a zig zag sequence by permuting the array elements. A sequence will be called a zig zag sequence if the first k elements in the sequence are in increasing order and the last k elements are in decreasing order, where k = (n+1)/2. You need to find the lexicographically smallest zig zag sequence of the given array.

Example:
a = [2, 3, 5, 1, 4] 
Now if we permute the array as [1, 4, 5, 3, 2], the result is a zig zag sequence.

Debug the given function findZigZagSequence to return the appropriate zig zag sequence for the given input array.

Note: 
You can modify at most three lines in the given code. You cannot add or remove lines of code.

'''
Input Format:- 
The first line contains t the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains an integer n, denoting the number of array elements. The next line of the test case contains n elements of array a.
'''

'''
Constraints:- 
 1 ≤ t ≤ 20 
 1 ≤ n ≤ 10000 (n is always odd)
 1 ≤ a(i) ≤ 10^9 
'''

'''
Output Format:- 
For each test cases, print the elements of the transformed zig zag sequence in a single line.
